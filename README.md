# BoardGame
A game with 2 agents, black and white.
in each step for each player, agent should move its element(black or white) and jump from opponent's element. so the agent's element can locate in an empty place or remove opponent's element and take its place. so an agent can move 
if number of moves for an agent became zero, it loses the game and it's opponent wins. so when agent's elements could not jump at least over one of opponent's element, it losses the game.
To reach goal that briefly explained, class MinimaxPlayer and class alphaBetaPrunning implemented az two algorithms to play the game in two different way beside other wayes have implemented before.
