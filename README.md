# BoardGame
The game is with 2 agents, black and white.
in each step for each player, agent should move its element(black or white) and jump over opponent's element. so the agent's element can locate in an empty place or remove opponent's element and take that place. in each step if number of moves for an agent became zero, it loses the game and it's opponent wins. so when agent could not move its elements by jumping at least one of them over  opponent's element, it losses the game.
To reach goal that briefly explained, class Minimax Player and class alphaBeta Pruning, implemented as two algorithms to play the game in two different way beside other ways have implemented before.
